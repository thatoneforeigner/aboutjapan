					when pronouncing a word in Japanese.

					4 different types of pitch accent 
				</div>
					<div class="body-row-one" style="margin-top:30px">
						Every word in Japanese has a type of pitch accent that creates 
						a particular sound for its word. <br> It is fundamental in Japanese intonation
						and is key for a non-native speaker to understand if they are trying to acquire
						the language to reach native-fluency.
					</div>
				<div>
				<h3 class="sub-header" id="why-is-pitch-accent-important"> Why is Pitch Accent Important?</h3>
				</div>
					<div class="body-row-one">
						In the Japanese language, there are only 46 basic kana (what we would call letters) in
						each of the two alphabets (hiragana and katakana). <br>
						Furthermore, these kana are completely phonetic which means that their sound does <strong>NOT</strong> change
						depending on what word it is.
					</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin">
						This is important when it comes to Japanese because when it comes Kanji, its third writing system, there tend
						to be many homophones in the thousands of kanji present. <br> 
						Kanji is derived from the Chinese writing system hence the 
						name 漢字 (kanji) [Chinese Letters]. These Chinese letters have
						tons of similarly spelled words but in China are pronounced differently due to a part of intonation they have known as "Tones."
						This partly means that when being transferred into the Japanese writing system, there were tons of similarly spelled and pronounced
						words. 
					</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin">
						This thankfully has changed over time making the language much easier to understand. I believe pitch accent has a good amount to do with
						this change because without it, certain words become very ambiguous and confusing and can mean two or more totally different things from each other.

						How pitch accent affects words
					</div>
				<div style="margin-top:30px">
				<h3 class="sub-header" id="is-pitch-accent-necessary">Is Pitch Accent Necessary?</h3>
				</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin">
						Like mentioned earlier, Pitch accent is one of the core parts to Japanese. It differentiates meanings between words
						with the same spelling and is the basis to natural sounding japanese intonation.
					</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin" style="margin-bottom:36px;">
						However, for most instances, pitch accent is <u>not entirely necessary</u>. <br>
						In most daily conversations, while you're pitch accent may possible be off, most native speakers can understand what you're trying to say
						by context. Instead, it's more important to focus on speaking gramatically correct rather than trying to perfect Japanese pronunciation. There are definitely many cases (and professions)
						where you do <b>NOT</b> need perfect pitch accent as far as language is concerned.

						That being said, if you want to pursue pitch accent, here is an important tip to consider: <br>
						Don't focus on the process of learning how to analyze pitch accent, but 
						instead being able to hear differences in pitch and subconsciously convert your speech into different sounds without 
						difficulty. While at first it seems daunting with all those pitch accent arrows and thousands of words to study pitch 
						accent for, the goal is not to learn all of it, but instead put a subconscious base into your mind that allows you to process 
						accented words natively and intuitively without thinking about it (<i>Pure Meaning Input</i> is what I call it).
					</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin">
						Just like how you learn and memorize your times table and PEMDAS for elementary math so you don't even have to think about 
						it when doing harder math classes (i.e. derivatives for calculus), pitch accent operates the same way. It's unrealistic 
						to think you can master every single pitch accent in Japanese without having the prerequisite understanding already engrained 
						in your brain. However, it's unrealistic as well to ignore and toss aside the existence of a fundamental part of a language and 
						think you've attained native-fluency. Foreign language acquisition is different from innate in that being a native speaker doesn't
						require you to think or even acknowledge these discrepancies, but a foreign language will.
					</div>
				<div>
				<h3 class="sub-header" id="personal-thoughts">Personal Thoughts On Pitch Accent</h3>
				</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin">
						I find that many people particularly argue back and forth between the practicality of learning pitch accent: whether it's useful for learners
						or if it's too much of a hassle. <br>
						I personally think that there is no right side on the matter as pursuing 100% proficiency in any language is a personal choice
						and has its own set of pros and cons.
					</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin">
						Many people are completely fine with just being fluent in a language and being able to have proper, natural conversations without the extra unnecessary
						semantics that not even native speakers know. Plus in real life, there aren't many cases where people will berate your accent nor likely care for that matter.
						The differences between in how you say "箸「はし」 (HAshi)" or "橋「はし」 (haSHI)" ultimately <b>DO NOT MATTER</b> as long as there is <strong>CONTEXT</strong> for someone to understand.
					</div>
					<div class="body-row-one margin">
						However, if you aspire to be as good sounding in Japanese as you can get, then there is no fault in learning and mastering pitch accent either. <br>
						In the end, It's just up to what <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">YOU</span> want to get out of the language.
