    Having recently visited Japan as a foreigner, I was able to experience so many 
	awesome things and visit various places which I thought was too good not share. 
	I would like to share with you guys that could maybe persuade you to check out 
	Japan (of course 	with sufficient funds). So here are personally <b>7 things </b> 
	that I hope will entice you to check out Japan!
<ol>
<br> 
<li><h3>Tokyo Skytree Tower</h3></li>
<br>
	<img src="http://www.travelcaffeine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tokyo-skytree-dusk-water-japan-bricker.jpg" alt="Tokyo Skytree" width="400" height="400">
<br>
<br>
  	Standing as the <strong>TALLEST</strong> skycraper in the world is the
	<u>Tokyo Skytree</u> standing at 634 meters tall. <br> Not 	only is it the 
	tallest tower in the world but it's a great and very popular tourist viewpoint. 
	I believe the view up there to be 	<b>INCREDIBLE</b> and I suggest that if you
	want a good city-view of Tokyo then you should definitely check this place out!
<br>
<br>
<li><h3> <b> Akihabara </b></h3></li>
<br>
<br>
	<img src="https://resources.matcha-jp.com/resize/720x2000/2023/07/27-142008.webp" alt="Akihabara" width="30%" height="30%">
<br>
<br>
	If you're a huge fan of modern Japanese culture, specifically anime and its 
	various cafes, then this is just the place for you! 	Having a wide variety 
	of shops and stores to chose from, Akihabara has most notably places like: 
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Animato</li>
 	<li>Neko Cafe</li>
	<li>Maid Cafe <i>(The infamous maid cafe lmao)</i></li>
	<li>Bic Camera</li>
	<li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<br> 
	And <b>ESPECIALLY</b> If you're a huge anime fan, animato has every corner 
	of every manga covered! you'll enjoy everything about 	Akihabara! from the 
	eccentric personalities and dresses to the absoluetly adorable cats in the 
	neko cafe and the loads of anime you can find about!
<br>
<br>
<li><h3>The Ridiculously Tasty Food</h3></li>
<br>
<br>
	<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160823142211-japan-food1-ishikawa-sushi-kanazawa-cityjnto.jpg?q=w_1600,h_900,x_0,y_0,c_fill/w_1280" alt="Sushi" width="30%" height="30%">
<br>
<br>
	If there's any reason you should go to Japan, it <u>HAS</u> to be the food. 
	There's an <b>ENDLESS</b> amount of options to 	choose from and almost* all 
	of them are perfect imo (<i>except Nato. I have strong feelings about that 
	one</i>).<br>With minor 	exceptions, Japanese food is extremely delicious 
	and healthy as well which means you can devour away and carry on with minimal 
	consequences! Some of my personal favorites are here:
<ul>
<br>
	<li>Tonkatsu</li>
	<li>Cup Noodle Ramen</li>
	<li>Sushi</li>
	<li>Okonomiyaki</li>
	<li>Ramen</li>
	<li>Fried Rice</li>
</ul>
<br>
	If you come to Japan, <u>don't</u> be reluctant to try their food.
	I <b>PROMISE</b> you won't regret it!
<br>
<br>
<li>
<h3>Historical Structures</h3>
</li>
<br>
<br>
	<img src="https://www.japan-guide.com/g18/3033_01.jpg" alt="Nihonbashi" width="30%" height="30%">
<br>
<br>
	Japan has a lot of complex and vast historic surrounding its origins. 
	Its historical and religious differences have heavily shaped much of the way Japan
	operates the way it does. So if you are interested in the historical significance of
	how Japan came about, definitely check these places out!
<br>
<br>
<li>
<h3> Etiquette and Social Culture</h3>
</li>
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Japantown_SF_Peace_Plaza_during_2010_NCCBF_2010-04-18_3.JPG/330px-Japantown_SF_Peace_Plaza_during_2010_NCCBF_2010-04-18_3.JPG" alt="japanese people" width="30%" height="30%">
<br>
<br>
    Japan has a very sophisticated social strucuture and hierarchy defining the way they function in society.
	For example, Their everyday speech consists of <i>formal</i> and <i>informal</i> interactions and they 
	follow a different set of rules and morals completely different from America such as <b id="bushido">Bushido</b>.
<br>
<br>
	Some of these little cultural differences are:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Refraining from things that make you stand out in public settings. </li>
		<br>In Japan, most people don't yell and abruptly or suddenly make outbursts or any noticeable comments of any kind in an ordeer to maintain
		cohesiveness as a whole unit instead of unique individuals (Group > Individual).
	<br><br>
	<li>Bow your head. Don't use too much physical touch.</li>
		<br>Bowing is a customary way of greeting others, apologizing, saying goodbyes, and much more
		Physical touch often can make Japanese people feel uncomfortable, so please stick to customs by
		bowing instead. 
	<br><br>
	<li>Most importantly...<b>DON'T SIT ON THE FLOOR!</b>
		<br><br>Okay now this one isn't so much of a rule, I just found it funny because it would keep repeatedly getting mentioned
		during my trip in Japan. It's true however that not many people in Japan so willingly sit on the floor
		as they would much rather stand up or try and find a seat instead.
		    
	</li>
	
</ul>
<br>
<br>
	If you are one who's fascinated with this aspect of Japanese culture, 
	it's definitely worth checking out!
<br>
<br>
<li>
<h3>Cleanliness</h3>
</li>
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://blog.japanwondertravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clean-street-japan-1200x750.jpg" alt="clean japanese streets" width="30%" hieght="30%">
<br>
<br>
    One very amazing thing about Japan is despite the reliant use on public 
	transportation systems, walking, and cycling mainly to get to locations,
	Japanese areas are mostly completely <b>clean</b> and <strong>devoid</strong> of garbage. 
	It's a breath of fresh air if you're from America where everywhere 
	is riddled with bits and pieces of garbage. Here in Japan however, 
	you'll have trouble even finding a piece of garbage. Even weirder, 
	they have LESS garabage bins sitting around than America.
<br>
<br>
<li>
<h3>Great Tourist locations!
</h3>
</li>
    Overall, <b class="japan-color">Japan</b> has tons of great places to check out just to sightsee and get a new look at of Japan as a whole. There are places like:

	<p class="body">If you have time, <b>DEFINITELY</b> check those places out!!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p id="end-section"> 
	Overall, Japan is a very great place to visit in my super biased opinon.
	It's important that if you're traveling, please be aware of the language barrier, customs and traditions,
	and be open-minded to the change. Your experience will be nothing short of <i>exhilariating</i>.
<br>
<br>
	Also, make sure to check for additional info on Japan before coming there so you can stay up to date!
